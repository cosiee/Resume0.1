use page.load to have elements appear in the correct spot on load

Arrow inactive/invisible when the me element is active (done-AC)

Adjust scrollDist height for rotate screens???? not sure its more for horizontal sml devices

Thumbnails overlay fixed on smaller screens (done-AC)

Modal text, form text adjusting....(done-AC)

Site Navigation is correct, note navigation behaviour links to around form 
'#statementContact' is this avoidable?

Ease the animations on 'ME' ie. "transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out;"
