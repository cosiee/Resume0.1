Cloud transitions the end point for the cloud transition to index.html is the begining 
keyframes for the mountain sky animation. can a 3 point loop ofclouds be worked- cloud 
transition start point finishing at mountainSky starting points and this has a end point,
which feeds to cloud transition start point... specifcally only thought of index.htmt 
More thought for other pages required. shifting of svg's z-index...




handling of form, WIP and modal on photography == for all pages

if slider is in viewport, it is sliding. Not in viewport slider is not using resources

cloud animation between pages?

spaceOutThumbs() index.html behaves differently.  As expected:
click 'contact'click formClose: correctly
click 'me' click modalClose: correctly
click 'me' click 'signature' and then click formClose: NOT correct!

reposition WIP to match that of Modal on all pages other than index.html
...furthering from this the disable and enable should close WIP if open

hide scroll bar when WIP msg shows


Finalising modularisation: move all index specific behaviour into mainModular.js from 
config & preload this should speed up loading.... and remove unwanted. Can you get 
lazy-images to work?
sexy up the code use extensions to speed this up comments and formatting

navbar 'contact' onclick needs to gather thumbnails

find and remove #meLink where possible
Other pages quickly...

NEXT...

Write ReadMe.txt 

'Me'click is jumpy when clicked needs to be smoother (Done-AC)

Get lazy-load working for thumbnails images...

fine tune WIP message positioning(done AC)

window.onload move to windowEventListener("load") (done-AC)

Regress main.js and than modularise required (done AC)

Why does the thumbnail overlay only work sometimes on smaller screens?
because there is a new layer created for fading in new image which doesn't have 
 the overlay trigger when is should. all behaviour for overlay hover and opacity 
 of 0.5 need to be given to fade layer or alternative needs to be sought... (DOne-AC)

 me and meshaker not working as required-fine tune code is there just not triggering. 
Is this a svg z-index issue? -(Done AC)

fix the thumbnail animation on index.html caused by working on the WIP, modal and 
form handling in photography.html NO PULL REQUEST TILL RESOLVED (Done-AC)

Remove scroll option on index on load, is scrolling still works for animation...? (Done-AC: auto scrolling 
working without scrollbar)

Navbar sticky rewrite logic, this:   (isLandscapeSmall && isSmallHeight && inSmallHeightScrollRange) ||
      (inNormalHeightScrollRange) is not working need t combine new logic with old but functions running
       resolve the problem . so combining the logic should work also so one function

when orientaion landscape &  screen size is below 991.98px Me element adjusts position
the thumbnails must do the same along with modal and form... is a chain reaction possible
at the stage? (done-AC)

dupilcated styles.css into pStyles.css and try new styled media queries seen here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6370690/media-queries-how-to-target-desktop-tablet-and-mobile (done-AC)

Blinking Thumbnails need to be present at all times( work done but not as desired yet-AC)(done-AC)
they start at correct random pace of change(transition) but this pace accerates over time. need
to maintain random even slow pace.

Sky1.webp not loading.(done-ac)

close button on WIP message not working on smaller screens, adjusted margin(done-AC)

Thumbnails overlay fixed on smaller screens (done-AC)

links to lead somewhere, use/go to git hub for now where possible(done for now-AC)

the close 'x' on the WIP statment t on smaller screens isn't workind. Why? and resolve.

Everything to load before it appears(done slows loading considerably-AC need reviewing...)

Barebones elements from index.html for all pages for site continuity

Adjust scrollDist height for rotate screens???? not sure its more for horizontal sml devices

use page.load to have elements appear in the correct spot on load

Site Navigation is correct, note navigation behaviour links to around form 
'#statementContact' is this avoidable?

Ease the animations on 'ME' ie. "transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out;"

Site needs to work online somewhere: github ....or?

adjust scoll arrow 'down' for all devices

Arrow inactive/invisible when the me element is active (done-AC)

Thumbnails overlay fixed on smaller screens (done-AC)

Modal text, form text adjusting....(done-AC)

overlay to be present on burger menu appears (done-AC)

elements to load and appear initially in position, not at origin then position(Done-AC)
